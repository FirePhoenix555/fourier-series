# fourier-series
An application of the [Fourier series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series) to recreate a drawing with rotating circles. See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6sGWTCMz2k) for an explanation of the math (requires calculus).

An old project, used for application into AP Computer Science A.

## Origin
I've always loved to watch [3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown). One day two years ago, during my freshman year (of high school), I watched [a certain video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6sGWTCMz2k) of his (probably for at least the second time) and felt inspired enough to try to recreate the circle drawings shown in the video.

This project brought me back to [a Coding Train video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY4luNgGfms) (or perhaps [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mm2eYfj0SgA)) I had seen a year or so prior to that, back in seventh or eighth grade when I was very interested in both computer science and math, but I stress that I *did not* rewatch these videos while writing the code for this website; unlike some other projects (I'm looking at [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flxOkx0yLrY)), the code for this one was entirely my own.

I was drawn back to this topic because of the beauty of the central mathematical idea in it, this one elegant integral:
$$c_n=\int _0^1 e^{-2\pi i n t} f(t) \ dt$$
Now, I'll explain more of what this integral is doing [in the math wiki] (or leave it up to [3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6sGWTCMz2k&t=982s)), but let me say right here that this is beautiful. It's amazing that such a simple formula can give such a complicated idea as representing a drawn path with infinite circles.
