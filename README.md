# fourier-series
An application of the Fourier series to recreate a drawing with rotating circles. See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6sGWTCMz2k) for an explanation of the math (requires calculus).

An old project, used for application into AP Computer Science A.

## Origin
I've always loved to watch [3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown). One day two years ago, during my freshman year, I watched [a certain video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6sGWTCMz2k) of his (probably for at least the second time) and felt inspired enough to try to recreate the circle drawings shown in the video.
